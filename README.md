# oracle-autonomous-transaction-processing-connection
A modified copy of Oracle's DataSourceSample.java for connecting to Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing 
Cloud DB using Oracle Wallet.

Don't forget to include the new JDBC Drivers to connect to Oracle Autonomous Transaction Database. 
In my test project I used the following libraries:
- ojdbc8.jar
- oraclepki.jar	
- osdt_cert.jar	
- osdt_core.jar	
- ucp.jar


Enjoy!
